  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This website contains an analysis of the PROG Token, which was found on Dextool and manually analyzed through Etherscan. Additionally, it was scanned through a crypto token contract scanner, Quick Intel. Below is a detailed breakdown of potential red flags and malicious behavior within the contract.</p>
</section>

<section id="red-flags">
  <h2>Red Flags in PROG Token</h2>

  <h3>Red Flag 1: Hidden Buy/Sell Taxes</h3>
  <p>The contract sets buy/sell taxes at 15%, which is unusually high and indicative of a honeypot scam.</p>

  <h3>Red Flag 2: Ownership Not Truly Renounced</h3>
  <p>The contract claims to renounce ownership but allows a privileged address (<code>_purpleforggg</code>) to retain control over the tokenâ€™s functionality.</p>

  <h3>Red Flag 3: Arbitrary Transaction Limits</h3>
  <p>The owner can remove transaction limits at any time, allowing for potential manipulation of when users can sell their tokens.</p>

  <h3>Red Flag 4: ETH Funneling to a Private Address</h3>
  <p>The swap function sends ETH to a private address during swaps, which could be used for a rug pull.</p>

  <h2>Quick Intel Analysis of Purple Frog (PROG)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Honeypot Test:</strong> FAILED</li>
    <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> No liquidity lock found; 0 WETH in liquidity pool.</li>
    <li><strong>Sell Tax:</strong> 100%, making it impossible for users to sell their tokens.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The combination of a failed honeypot test, no liquidity lock, and high sell tax strongly suggests this token is a honeypot scam.</p>

<section id="dextools">
  <h2>DEXTools Analysis of Purple Frog (PROG)</h2>
  <h3>Key Findings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Liquidity Drain:</strong> Over $41,000 removed from the liquidity pool by the owner.</li>
    <li><strong>Suspicious Owner Activity:</strong> A massive sell order resulted in a drastic drop in token value.</li>
    <li><strong>Price Volatility:</strong> Extreme price swings suggest a pump-and-dump scam.</li>
    <li><strong>Rug Pull:</strong> Clear signs of a rug pull, with no remaining liquidity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The DEXTools analysis shows that this token is a scam, with the owner conducting a rug pull and leaving the investors trapped.</p>

<!-- New section for Manual Analysis -->
<section id="manual-analysis">
  <h2>Manual Analysis</h2>
  <p>After discovering the PROG token on Dextools, I manually analyzed the contract using Etherscan. Here are the key steps I followed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Retrieved the token contract from Dextools and located the contract address on Etherscan.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Analyzed the contract functions, identifying several red flags, including hidden taxes and a fake ownership renouncement.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Ran the contract through Quick Intel and other token scanner websites to confirm the findings.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Based on the scan results, verified that the token was a honeypot scam, with no liquidity and a 100% sell tax.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> This analysis confirmed that the PROG token is a honeypot scam designed to trap investors, with control retained by the contract owner despite claims of decentralization.</p>
</section>


<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Based on my analysis, this contract has multiple red flags that could indicate a malicious or scam token, including hidden taxes, lack of true decentralization, and arbitrary control over transactions. Investors should be cautious when interacting with tokens of this nature.</p>
  <p>By conducting this analysis, I have demonstrated my ability to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Manually analyze smart contracts for potential vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>Use blockchain tools like Etherscan and Quick Intel.</li>
    <li>Understand key red flags that indicate possible scams in token contracts.</li>
  </ul>
