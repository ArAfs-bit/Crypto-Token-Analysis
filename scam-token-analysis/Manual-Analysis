Manual Analysis Using Etherscan:
I reviewed the contract manually on Etherscan by inspecting the code to identify malicious or suspicious sections. Based on my analysis, here are the key issues:

Red Flag 1: Hidden Buy/Sell Taxes (Potential Scam)
Problem:
-The contract includes high initial taxes for both buys and sells, set at 15% (_initBuyTax and _initSellTax).
-While it's common for tokens to have taxes for liquidity and development, such high taxes (15%) without clear transparency are often indicative of a "honeypot" scam.
Explanation:
A honeypot scam means that users may find it difficult to sell the token after buying because the sell tax might be too high, resulting in large losses for the seller.

Red Flag 2: Ownership Not Truly Renounced (Centralized Control)
Problem:
The contract claims to be renounced ownership, but the owner retains privileges, especially over important parameters like buy/sell taxes. There is an address _purpleforggg which seems to have special privileges.
Explanation:
A truly decentralized contract should not allow the owner or any other address to manipulate critical functions. Here, _purpleforggg may still be able to alter the token’s behavior, which is another indication of potential malicious control.

Red Flag 3: Arbitrary Control Over Transactions (Malicious Intent)
Problem:
-The contract sets limits on transactions and wallets (e.g., _maxTxAmount and _maxWalletSize) but allows the owner to remove these limits without warning.
-The contract has a “prevent swap before” limit, which can manipulate when the user is allowed to sell tokens.
Explanation:
This allows the developer to manipulate the selling process or block users from selling their tokens by dynamically changing transaction limits or taxes.

Red Flag 4: Special Tax on Swap Transactions
Problem:
The function swapTokensForEth() swaps tokens for ETH, but it sends ETH to the _purpleforggg address, which could potentially funnel funds out of the liquidity pool, leading to a rug pull.
Explanation:
In legitimate contracts, swap functions are used for liquidity pool management or token buybacks, but here it looks like ETH could be transferred directly to a private wallet.
