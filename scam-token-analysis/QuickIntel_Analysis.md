Quick Intel Analysis Findings:

Honeypot Test: Failed
Explanation: The honeypot test checks if users can sell the token after purchasing it. If the test fails, it suggests that investors may be able to buy tokens but not sell them, making it a potential "honeypot" scam.

Liquidity Issues:
Liquidity: There is no liquidity pool lock found, and there is no liquidity available (0 WETH). This is a huge red flag since it indicates that the project's creators have not secured liquidity, making it easy for them to pull out funds and scam investors.

Tax Breakdown:
100% Sell Tax: The token has a 100% sell tax, meaning anyone trying to sell the token will lose their entire amount. This tax setup is another common indicator of a scam or honeypot.

Suspicious Ownership:
The contract's owner and creator wallet are often red flags, but in this case, the owner details are hidden. This lack of transparency can signal a lack of accountability.

Conclusion:
The findings from Quick Intel strongly suggest that this token is a scam, specifically a honeypot. The combination of a failed honeypot test, 100% sell tax, and no liquidity lock are major indicators of a malicious project designed to trap investors and prevent them from selling once theyâ€™ve bought in.
